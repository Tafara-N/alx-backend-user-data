# Background Context

In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

In the industry, you should **not** implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth]()). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.



# Resources

**Read or watch:**
- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms]()
- [Base64 in Python]()
- [HTTP header Authorization]()
- [Flask]()
- [Base64 - concept]()

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](), **without the help of Google:**

## General
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header

# Requirements

## Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version `3.7`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation ( python3 -c
'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)' )
All your classes should have a documentation ( python3 -c
'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)' )
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ( python3 -c
'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c
'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)' )
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the
module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
